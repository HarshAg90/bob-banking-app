# THE 7 PROMPTS — STEP BY STEP

---

# P1 — Prompt 1: Architecture & Planning *(~5 min)*

Ask the AI to produce a high-level implementation plan. No code is written yet — purely a planning document covering architecture, folder structure, module breakdown and a development roadmap.

**Output:** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

## Prompt Text: *(in Plan Mode)*

```
Create a high-level implementation plan in Markdown (.md) named as
IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for a Banking Web Application.

Technology:

• Frontend: HTML, Bootstrap (FRONTEND folder)
• Backend: Python Flask (BACKEND folder)
• Database: SQLite (in backend)

Features:

• Customer Login
• Dashboard
• View Balance
• Deposit Funds
• Withdraw Funds
• Logout

Generate a concise architecture and planning document.

Include:

1. Solution Overview
   • Objective
   • Scope
   • Users
   • Functional requirements
   • Non-functional requirements
   • Assumptions

2. High-Level Architecture
   • Architecture diagram
   • Frontend → Backend → Database interaction
   • Request lifecycle

3. Component Design
   • Frontend responsibilities
   • Backend responsibilities
   • Database responsibilities

4. Folder Structure
   • Project directory
   • Responsibility of each folder

5. Module Breakdown
   • Authentication
   • Dashboard
   • Account Management
   • Transactions

6. Implementation Roadmap
   • Development phases
   • Estimated effort
   • Dependencies

Keep this document at planning level only.

Do NOT generate database schema, SQL scripts, API contracts, or detailed implementation steps.
```

## Covers

- ✓ Solution overview (objective, scope, users, requirements)
- ✓ High-level architecture with request lifecycle
- ✓ Component design for frontend, backend and database
- ✓ Folder structure with responsibilities
- ✓ Module breakdown and implementation roadmap

> **Tip:** No SQL, API contracts or code in this step. Planning only.

3. Frontend Implementation
   • Login page
   • Dashboard
   • Deposit form
   • Withdraw form
   • Bootstrap layout

4. Integration Steps
   • Connect frontend to APIs
   • Connect Flask to SQLite

5. Validation Rules
   • Login validation
   • Balance validation
   • Deposit/withdraw checks

6. Testing
   • Unit tests
   • Integration tests
   • Manual testing checklist

7. Deployment
   • Run locally
   • Production considerations

Generate plain english instructions & and logic of how to implement and not the entire code.
```

## Covers

- ✓ Environment setup — virtualenv, Flask, dependencies
- ✓ Backend implementation — routes, controllers, session handling
- ✓ Frontend implementation — login, dashboard, deposit & withdraw forms
- ✓ Integration steps, validation rules and testing checklist
- ✓ Deployment — local run and production considerations

> **Tip:** Use `@/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` as context in your prompt.

# P3 — Prompt 3: Full Application Build *(~10 min)*

The main build step. Reference the implementation guide and ask the AI to build the entire application end-to-end, module by module, following the defined architecture.

**Output:** `FRONTEND/ BACKEND/ SQLite DB`

## Prompt Text: *(auto switch to Agent Mode)*

```text
Refer to @/STEP_BY_STEP_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md and begin implementing the end-to-end full-stack banking application.

Review the implementation guide thoroughly and follow the defined architecture, project structure, and development sequence. Build the application incrementally across all layers:

1. Frontend – Implement the UI components, pages, routing, state management, and API integration.

2. Backend – Develop APIs, business logic, authentication, validation, and service layers.

3. Database – Create schema, models, migrations, and data access layer.

4. Integration – Connect frontend, backend, and database end-to-end.

5. Security & Configuration – Apply authentication, authorization, environment configuration, and secure coding practices.

6. Testing – Add unit, integration, and functional tests.

7. Execution – Ensure the application runs locally with clear startup instructions.

Start with project setup and foundation components, then proceed module by module according to the implementation guide.
```

## Covers

- ✓ Frontend — UI pages, Bootstrap layout, form handling
- ✓ Backend — Flask APIs, business logic, authentication
- ✓ Database — schema, models, data access layer
- ✓ Integration — frontend, backend and SQLite connected end-to-end
- ✓ Security config and startup instructions included

> **Tip:** Use `@/STEP_BY_STEP_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` as context. This is the longest step.

# P4 — Prompt 4: Push to GitHub *(~10 min)*

Push the completed local application to a new GitHub repository using the GitHub MCP connection, excluding environment, cache and database files.

**Output:** `GitHub repository: bob-banking-app`

## Prompt Text

```text
Using the GitHub MCP connection, push my local banking application to GitHub.

Look up my GitHub username from the authenticated token — do not guess it.

1. Create a new public repository on my GitHub account named:

   bob-banking-app

   - Description:
     "Banking web application built with Flask, SQLite and Bootstrap"

   - Initialise it with a README

2. Push all files from my local workspace to the main branch EXCEPT:

   - anything inside venv/
   - anything inside __pycache__/ folders
   - anything inside .bob/
   - anything inside .pytest_cache/
   - any file ending in .pyc
   - any file ending in .db
   - the docs/ folder

3. Confirm the repository URL once all files are pushed.
```

## Covers

- ✓ New public GitHub repository created and initialised
- ✓ Local codebase pushed to the main branch

**Output:** `.github/workflows/banking-app-ci.yml`

## Prompt Text

```text
Using the GitHub MCP connection, add the CI/CD pipeline file to my repository.

Look up my GitHub username from the authenticated token — do not guess it.

1. In the repository bob-banking-app on my GitHub account, create the file at this exact path:

   .github/workflows/banking-app-ci.yml

2. Use the contents of the file I have saved locally at:

   Docs/demo-setup/banking-app-ci.yml

3. Commit it with the message:

   "Add CI/CD pipeline"

4. Confirm the file is visible in the repository.
